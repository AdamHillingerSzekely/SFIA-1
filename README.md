# Research and Development into Advanced Manufacturing Revision tool

V1.0

## Overview

The R and D into AM Revision tool was created for the practical purpose of exam preparation (MSc in Advanced Mechanical Engineering). The user is a provided with an inbuilt randomised set of questions which are 'fed' to the user until the question given is answered correctly. Only when all questions are answered correctly will the quiz end. An analysis page is then generated, illustrating the number of times each question was answered incorrectly. This provides the user knowledge of which areas of the course material require further revision.

## The Brief

In order to meet the requirements of SFIA-1 it was necessary to fulfil the CRUD criteria. In addition, it was necessary to utilise methodologies and applications in support of the application as well as creating complementary documentation.

## Requirements
  - The creation of a Trello Board (See Japanese concept of Kanban) to illustrate user requirements, degrees of difficulty for each facet of the overall design, user stories and timeframes in which you expect to complete phases of work. 
  - Utilisation of a relational database using SQL. To demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the proposeed architecture, create a complementary entity relationship diagram.
  - Supporting documentation created during the planning phase including a risk assessment.
  - The implementation of CRUD using the python programming language and Flask website framework.
  - Validation of the functionality of the website using automated testing in keeping with the test driven development methodology.
